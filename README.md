In this project, we have a HospitalManagementSystem class that manages the admission and discharge of patients. 
It contains a list of patients and methods to admit and discharge patients. The main method demonstrates how to 
use the HospitalManagementSystem class by creating an instance of it, admitting patients, and discharging a patient. 
Additionally, we have a Patient class that represents a patient with name and age attributes.
